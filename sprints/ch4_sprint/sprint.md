Jackson will set up a new template for a goals page where a person can track their dietary goals using the recipes.
Derek will roadmap a large portion of the rest of the project laying out what functionality needs to be done in sequence to one another.

The main goal is to start adding some of our functionality to the website and mapping out how it will look moving forward.

### Action Items

Add a way to "share a post" of a recipe and add it to the database.
Create a new section of the website to implement a macro tracker.
Implement a detailed roadmap for moving forward.

### Issues and Risks

Each of our tasks are independent, so we shouldn't collide in errors.
We may run into errors in terms of implementing exactly what we are visualizing, but hopefully we can troubleshoot.

### Team Work Assignments

Jack will have a working way of posting recipes that can add to the database.
Jackson will implement another "page" to the website.
Derek will document out a working roadmap making sprints and planning easier moving forward.
