### User Story

Have more specific goals to track

### Completed Requirements

Have more specific goals to track

### Incomplete Requirements


### The summary of the entire project

We now have a cleaner page overall, with more ways to describe recipes in our form post, and a goals page with  
a progress bar to track goals for the future. Nginx is now used as our server instead of flask exposing a localhost port.

### Planning

We plan to make a pop-out feature to keep the site neat, only expanding one recipe at a time. We plan to also create a button  
on this pop-out that allows a user to add that recipe's macros to a goal they have set on the separate goals page.
