### The summary of the entire project

We are able to build using "docker-compose up --build" to get an instance running to the localhost.  
Once running, the site allows a user to view and submit (very basic) recipes.  
The user can also switch to a second "Goals" page and set (very basic) goals for themselves.

We also made a roadmap to help us decide our next steps in the project.
