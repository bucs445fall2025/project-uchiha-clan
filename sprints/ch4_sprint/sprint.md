The main goal is to start adding some of our functionality to the website and mapping out how it will look moving forward.<br>

### Action Items

Add a way to "share a post" of a recipe and add it to the database.<br>
Create a new section of the website to implement a macro tracker.<br>
Implement a detailed roadmap for moving forward.<br>

Each of our tasks are independent, so we shouldn't collide in errors.<br>
We may run into errors in terms of implementing exactly what we are visualizing, but hopefully we can troubleshoot.<br>

Jackson will implement another "page" to the website.<br>
